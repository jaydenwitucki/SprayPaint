Project for Final Cover

Was not sure how to create WPF project on my OS (Mac (and I do not think you can, although I could create other .NET projects)), so I built the project in JavaFX.

JavaFX SDK added to the project files.
Java JDK installed prior to creating
Used intellij plugins for JavaFX to intialize project

1. User can run the project
2. User can load an image
3. User can begin spray painting on said image, and can change color, density.
4. User can save image to their machine
5. User can come back to the proiect and load the intial image with no spray paint, and can either edit from there with an empty image, or can pull up a new image, or can pull up the saved image
6. User can erase spray paint from image
